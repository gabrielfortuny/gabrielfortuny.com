This is my personal website designed and developed from the ground up using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I built this site to share a little bit about myself and showcase my projects.

I decided early on to design the site from scratch as a challenge to myself to master core web development principles including responsive design and accessibility standards. The minimalist layout serves to highlight my background and project experience to visitors.

Technical Details:

- Built with Jekyll static site generator for efficient content management
- Implemented modern CSS techniques including Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Optimized for responsiveness and accessibility across all devices
- Automatic dark mode for improved user experience
- Deployed via GitHub Pages for seamless continuous integration
- Version controlled with Git for iterative development
