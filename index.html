    <p>
      Iâ€™m passionate about building clean, elegant software that has a meaningful impact. I'm
      proficient in Python, C++, and SQL, but I'm always learning more and growing with every
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      My multidisciplinary background has strengthened my critical thinking, leadership, and
      organizational skills, so I'm ready to take on any new challenge with curiosity and
      creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I love reading (my favorite book is
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55030.Cosmos"><em>Cosmos</em></a>
      by Carl Sagan), cooking, and watching movies at the
      <a href="https://marquee-arts.org/">Michigan Theater</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to check out my some of my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, and get in
      <a href="/contact/">contact</a> to collaborate or learn more about me.
