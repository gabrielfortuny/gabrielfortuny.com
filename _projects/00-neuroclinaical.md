I am currently working with a team to develop an iOS app that helps clinicians treat patients with epilepsy. The app summarizes patient reports and extracts key insights to support more informed clinical decisions.

As the team’s Software Architect, I’ve been responsible for the overall design and organization of the backend system. This role has given me hands-on experience in structuring a complex software project and coordinating technical decisions across the team.

Tools and Technologies Used:

- Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- Docker
- OpenAPI Specifications, Postman, Insomnia
- Ollama

Key Takeaways:

- Practiced schema-first, modular design
- Designed and organized a large-scale software project
- Bridged communication between frontend and backend teams
- Improved Git workflows and collaboration
- Developed a deeper appreciation for clean, maintainable architecture
