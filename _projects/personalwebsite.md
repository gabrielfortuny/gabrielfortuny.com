This is my personal website, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a simple static website that I use to share a little bit about myself and showcase my projects.

I did this project to solidify my web development skills that I picked up through self learning and a few classes.

Technologies used:

- Jekyll
- GitHub Pages
- HTML
- CSS
