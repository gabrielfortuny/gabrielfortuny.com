I developed a C# library for managing Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) classroom cameras using the VISCA protocol. This project arose from an identified need within my organization for a more efficient camera control solution.

The library provides developers with an intuitive interface to integrate PTZ camera control into their applications. Key features include precise camera movement controls, zoom functionality, and advanced configuration options through standardized VISCA commands.

This project was a learning opportunity for me, as I taught myself C# and .NET fundamentals from scratch to deliver a solution to solve this real-world problem.
